This repository contains a simple COBOL program that demonstrates a common data type handling error, specifically numeric overflow. The program initializes a numeric field and then attempts to increment it beyond its defined capacity. This results in an error or unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates how to fix the issue by using a data type that can accommodate the expected range of values.
